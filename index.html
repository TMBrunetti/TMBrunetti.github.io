        <p> Virtual Pet was a project done in 3 iterations, including a solo pet, a pet shelter, then a shelter of real
          and robotic animals.
          Explaining it to other people was always the fun part. The coding was challenging as it was my first big
          endeavor with using Java
          for OOP, abstract classes, designing tests, running a working application, and allowing a user to interact
          with an array list.
          Within a couple weeks I became comfortable with instantiating variables, creating methods, creating
          characterstics in abstract classes,
          and calling upon methods and classes from concrete and abstract pages to make a working application.

        <p>Streaming Sites Review was our first group project. It was a great way to work with others strengths and
          weaknesses.
          I established the GitHub properties, mapped out what our project should look like, added elements to the HTML
          and CSS,
          and coordinated the KanBan. During the second through fifth sprints we worked
          together to
          create a working MVC using Thymeleaf in IntelliJ through a mob coding apporach with the Agile Method.
